## Liwe - under work

taken from github.com/hexive/sunpaper which was written in bash, but wasnt working on my machine for some reason. 

Liwe is written in python (and kinda slow) but does the work perfectly, also smooth fading between wallpapers is added.

### Dependencies
+ [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh)
+ [screeninfo](https://pypi.org/project/screeninfo/)

### Run
```
git clone https://github.com/sohxm7/liwe.git
cd liwe
python init.py # run only one time
python liwe.py # run everytime you want to update wallpaper, as of now
```
